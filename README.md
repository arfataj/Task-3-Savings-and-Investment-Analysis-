## Project Details

### Objective:
To explore the relationship between savings objectives and investment avenues, highlighting patterns and trends through correlation analysis.

### Steps Performed:
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examined the relationship between savings objectives (Capital Appreciation, Growth, Income) and investment avenues (Equity, Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds, Public Provident Fund).
   - Identified a **Pearson correlation coefficient of -1**, indicating a perfect negative correlation.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Created charts to show the distribution of investment avenues based on savings objectives.

### Key Insights:
- **Perfect Negative Correlation**: A Pearson coefficient of -1 suggests an inverse relationship between savings objectives and investment avenues.
- **Capital Appreciation Dominates**: Most investments align with capital appreciation, except for Public Provident Funds, where growth is more prominent.
- **Distribution Insights**:
  - Capital Appreciation: 26 investments.
  - Growth: 11 investments.
  - Income: 3 investments.

## Tools Used:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data preparation.

## Visualizations:
The project includes:
- Correlation table showcasing the relationship between savings objectives and investment avenues.
- Bar charts displaying the distribution of investment avenues by savings objectives.
